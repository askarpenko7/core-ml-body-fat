# Body Fat Predictor App

This app leverages Apple's CoreML to predict body fat percentage, integrating a model trained on a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simonezappatini/body-fat-extended-dataset) comprising 252 male and 184 female measurements. The project showcases the application of ML in enhancing health and fitness tracking.

## Features
- Predict body fat percentage using user inputs.
- Utilizes CoreML for ML model integration.
- Built with Swift and SwiftUI for iOS.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and open the project in Xcode. Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed to handle Swift and SwiftUI efficiently.

## How It Works
The app uses a trained ML model to estimate body fat percentage based on various body measurements. Detailed insights into the training process and model deployment will be shared in future updates.
